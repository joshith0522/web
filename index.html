    <!-- Backend Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Backend Technologies</h2>
        <p>Backend development is responsible for managing data and serving the frontend. It handles server-side operations and database management. Common backend technologies include:</p>

        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server, making it possible to use JavaScript for full-stack development.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python is a versatile language often used in backend development due to its simplicity and extensive libraries, including popular frameworks like Django and Flask.</p>

        <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
        <p>Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby, known for its simplicity and speed in building web applications.</p>

        <h3>Database Technologies</h3>
        <p>Backend systems rely on databases to store and retrieve information. Popular databases include SQL-based systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and NoSQL options like MongoDB.</p>
